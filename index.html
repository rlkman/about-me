        <p>I am currently unemployed since I left my employment as the Assistant
        Curriculum Lead in charge of Computing in a Comprehensive English High
        School on the 30th June this year. I was also an ICT and Computing
        teacher for ages 11 to 18. I completed my teacher training course and
        got registered with the General Teaching Council of England in 2007.
        I have strong analytical capabilities, computer, written and
        oral communication skills. I have the ability to independently manage
        my own workload, set priorities, meet deadlines and adjust to
        change.</p>
